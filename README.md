# structural-complexity

Using this script one can calculate structural complexity for ferromagnetic/paramagnetic phase transition in Ising model on square lattice 1024x1024. Configurations to be used are located in data.7z
In the input file one can specify the following parameters:
!n-linear lattice dimension from input file
!number of overlaps to be calculated 
!step k at which we start to calculate complexity (less than the previous number)
!lambda - linear dimension of the filter
!number of configurations
